a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal. 
b If no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive therapy. Upon resolution (Grade 0), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month, after which IMFINZI can be resumed based on clinical judgment. 
c Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if adverse reaction does not resolve to ó Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory insufficiency. 
d Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if adverse reaction does not resolve to ó Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory insufficiency; and, in addition to these signs, for myasthenia gravis, if there are signs of autonomic insufficiency. 
e Includes immune thrombocytopenia. 
 
For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude alternate aetiologies. Upon improvement to ó Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or using additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is worsening or no improvement. After withhold, IMFINZI can be resumed within 12 weeks if the adverse reactions improved to ó Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ó 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. IMFINZI should be permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) immune-mediated adverse reactions.  
For non-immune-mediated adverse reactions, withhold IMFINZI for Grade 2 and 3 adverse reactions until ó Grade 1 or baseline. IMFINZI should be discontinued for Grade 4 adverse reactions (with the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to discontinue should be based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment). <<END_SECTION>>

<<START_SUBHEADING>>Immune-mediated adverse reactions <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including durvalumab, can cause severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may involve any organ system. While immune-mediated reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also manifest after discontinuation.  Early identification of such reactions and timely intervention are an important part of the safe use of durvalumab. In clinical trials, most immune-mediated adverse reactions were reversible and managed with interruptions of durvalumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and managed as recommended in Table 2 (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Immune-mediated pneumonitis <<END_SUBHEADING>>

Immune-mediated pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease,* including fatal cases, occurred in patients receiving durvalumab in clinical trials (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects). 
Pneumonitis is frequently observed in patients receiving radiation therapy to the lung and the clinical presentation of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis is very similar. In the PACIFIC Study, in patients who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemoradiation within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the trial, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 161 (33.9%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 58 (24.8%) in the placebo group, including Grade 3 (3.4% vs 3.0%) and Grade 5 (1.1% vs 1.7%). See also Section 4.8 Adverse effects.  
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, and managed as recommended in Table 2 (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Immune-mediated hepatitis <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>Immune-mediated hepatitis,* including a fatal case, occurred in patients receiving durvalumab in clinical trials (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects).

<<START_SUBHEADING>>Use in the elderly <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>No overall differences in safety were observed between patients treated with IMFINZI who were ò 65 years of age compared to younger patients in the PACIFIC study (NSCLC). Data from NSCLC patients 75 years of age or older are limited. 
No overall differences in safety were observed between patients treated with IMFINZI who were ò 65 years of age compared to younger patients in the PACIFIC study (NSCLC). Data from NSCLC patients 75 years of age or older are limited. 
Of the 265 patients with ES-SCLC treated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy, 101 (38%) patients were 65 years or older. There were no overall clinically meaningful differences in safety or effectiveness between patients ò 65 years of age and younger patients.

<<START_SUBHEADING>>	4.5 	Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>Durvalumab is an immunoglobulin. The primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition, therefore no formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted since no metabolic drugdrug interactions are expected. PK drug-drug interaction between durvalumab and etoposide, and carboplatin or cisplatin was assessed in the CASPIAN study and no clinically meaningful PK drugdrug interaction between durvalumab and the chemotherapy was identified. <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>	4.6 	Fertility, pregnancy and lactation <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Effects on fertility <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>There are no data on the effects of durvalumab on fertility in humans. In repeat-dose toxicology studies of durvalumab up to 3 months duration in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys, there were no notable effects on the male and female reproductive organs. These animals received weekly doses of durvalumab yielding 11 times the clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the clinical dose of 1500 mg every 3 weeks and 23 times at the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Use in pregnancy ? Category D <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>There are no data on the use of durvalumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, durvalumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy and may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, durvalumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Durvalumab use is not recommended during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Animal data <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>As reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus. In mouse allogeneic pregnancy models, disruption of PD-L1 signalling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. The effects of durvalumab on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Durvalumab was administered from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 3 to 11 times the clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the clinical dose of 1500 mg every 3 weeks and 6 to 20 times at the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature delivery, foetal loss (abortion and stillbirth) and increase in neonatal deaths compared to concurrent controls. Durvalumab was detected in infant serum on postpartum Day 1, indicating the presence of placental transfer of durvalumab. Based on its mechanism of action, foetal exposure to durvalumab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response and immunemediated disorders have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice. <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Use in lactation <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>There is no information regarding the presence of durvalumab in human milk, the absorption and effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production.  Human IgG is excreted in human milk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys was associated with dose-related low-level excretion of durvalumab in breast milk and was associated with premature neonatal death compared to concurrent controls. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from durvalumab, lactating women should be advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>	4.7 	Effects on ability to drive and use machines <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, durvalumab is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. However, if patients experience adverse reactions affecting their ability to concentrate and react, they should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery. <<END_SECTION>>

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 3 lists the incidence of adverse reactions in the monotherapy safety dataset. Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ class in MedDRA. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are presented in decreasing frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each ADR is based on the CIOMS III convention and is defined as: very common (ò 1/10); common (ò 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (ò 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (ò 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not determined (cannot be estimated from available data).  <<END_SECTION>>

Adverse events are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse events are presented in decreasing frequency.  <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Locally advanced NSCLC ? PACIFIC study <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>The safety of IMFINZI in patients with locally advanced NSCLC who completed concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy within 42 days prior to initiation of study drug was evaluated in the PACIFIC study, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 475 patients received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The study excluded patients who had disease progression following chemoradiation, with active or prior autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression (see 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ? Clinical trials).

The study excluded patients who had disease progression following chemoradiation, with active or prior autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression (see 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ? Clinical trials). 
The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 90), 45% age 65 years or older, 70% male, 69% White, 27% Asian, 75% former smoker, 16% current smoker, and 51% had WHO performance status of 1. All patients received definitive radiotherapy as per protocol, of which 92% received a total radiation dose of 54 Gy to 66 Gy. The median duration of exposure to IMFINZI was 10 months (range: 0.2 to 12.6). 
IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse events in 15% of patients. The most common adverse events leading to IMFINZI discontinuation were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis in 6% of patients. Serious adverse events occurred in 29% of patients receiving IMFINZI. The most frequent serious adverse events reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (7%) and pneumonia (6%). Fatal pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis and fatal pneumonia occurred in < 2% of patients and were similar across arms. The most common adverse events (occurring in ò 20% of patients) were cough, fatigue, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspnoea and rash.

A total of 265 patients received IMFINZI 1500 mg in combination with chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by IMFINZI 1500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with active or prior autoimmune disease or with medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants [see 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ? Clinical trials).

A total of 265 patients received IMFINZI 1500 mg in combination with chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by IMFINZI 1500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with active or prior autoimmune disease or with medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants [see 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ? Clinical trials). 
Among 266 patients receiving chemotherapy alone, 57% of the patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 8% of the patients received PCI after chemotherapy. 
IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of the patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. These include pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis and pancytopenia (1 patient each). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of patients were febrile neutropenia (4.5%), pneumonia (2.3%), anaemia (1.9%), pancytopenia (1.5%), pneumonitis (1.1%)  and COPD (1.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4.9% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. These include pancytopenia, sepsis, septic shock, pulmonary artery thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and hepatitis (1 patient each) and sudden death (2 patients). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ò 20% of patients) were nausea, fatigue/asthenia and alopecia.

<<START_SUBHEADING>>Mechanism of action <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein is an adaptive immune response that helps tumours evade detection and elimination by the immune system. PD-L1 expression can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g. IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells in tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production. 
Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein is an adaptive immune response that helps tumours evade detection and elimination by the immune system. PD-L1 expression can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g. IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells in tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production. 
Durvalumab is a fully human, high affinity, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1?) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Durvalumab does not induce antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PDL1/CD80 interactions enhances antitumour immune responses. These antitumour responses may result in tumour elimination. 
In preclinical studies, PD-L1 blockade by durvalumab led to increased T-cell activation and decreased tumour size in xenograft mouse models of human melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer cells as well as mouse syngeneic colorectal cancer. <<END_SECTION>>
<<START_SUBHEADING>>Clinical trials <<END_SUBHEADING>>
<<START_SECTION>>Durvalumab doses of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1500 mg every 4 weeks were evaluated in NSCLC and ES-SCLC clinical studies. Based on the modelling and simulation of exposure, exposure-safety relationships and exposure-efficacy data comparisons, there are no anticipated clinically significant differences in efficacy and safety between durvalumab doses of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1500 mg every 4 weeks. <<END_SECTION>>

Randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC after chemoradiation (PACIFIC study) 
The efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC study, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 713 patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. Patients had completed at least 2 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemotherapy with radiation therapy within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study and had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Ninety-two percent of patients had received a total dose of 54 to 66 Gy of radiation. The study excluded patients who had progressed following chemoradiation therapy, patients with prior exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody, patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history of immunodeficiency; a history of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression(except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids); active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive 10 mg/kg IMFINZI (n=476) or 10 mg/kg placebo (n=237) via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or confirmed disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by gender, age (<65 years vs. ò 65 years) and smoking status (smoker vs. non- smoker). Patients with disease control at 12 months were given the option to be re-treated upon disease progression. Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter. 
Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumour PD-L1 expression level. Where available, archival tumour tissue specimens taken prior to chemoradiation therapy were retrospectively tested for PDL1 expression on tumour cells (TC) using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) IHC assay. Of the 713 patients randomised, 63% of patients provided a tissue sample of sufficient quality and quantity to determine PD-L1 expression and 37% were unknown.  
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (70%), age ò 65 years (45%), white (69%), Asian (27%), other (4%), current smoker (16%), past-smoker (75%), and never smoker (9%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (49%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (51%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IIIA (53%), Stage IIIB (45%), histological sub-groups of squamous (46%), non-squamous (54%).

<<START_SECTION>>The efficacy of IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin in previously untreated ES-SCLC patients was investigated in CASPIAN, a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in treatment nave ES-SCLC patients with WHO/ECOG performance status of  0 or 1. Patients in the trial were eligible to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen as firstline treatment for SCLC, with life expectancy ò12 weeks, at least one target lesion by RECIST 1.1 and adequate organ and bone marrow function. Patients with asymptomatic or treated brain metastases were permitted. The study excluded patients with a history of chest radiation therapy;  a history of active primary immunodeficiency; autoimmune disorders including paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS); active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; use of systemic immunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI.

Randomisation was stratified by the planned platinum-based therapy in cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin). 
? The evaluation of efficacy for ES-SCLC relied on comparison between: Arm 1: IMFINZI 1500 mg + etoposide (80-100 mg/m2) and either carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m2) 
? Arm 2: Either carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m2) on Day 1 and etoposide (80-100 mg/m2) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for between 4 and 6 cycles. 
 
For patients randomised to Arm 1 , etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin was limited to 4 cycles every 3 weeks subsequent to randomisation. IMFINZI monotherapy continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of IMFINZI monotherapy was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. 
Patients randomised to Arm 2, were permitted to receive a total of up to 6 cycles of etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin. After completion of chemotherapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was permitted only in Arm 2 per investigator discretion. 
Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted every 2 months following treatment discontinuation. 
The primary endpoints of the study were Overall Survival (OS) of IMFINZI + chemotherapy (Arm 
1) vs. chemotherapy alone (Arm 2). The key secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Other secondary endpoints were Objective Response Rate (ORR), OS and PFS landmarks and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO). PFS and ORR were assessed using Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1. 
At a planned interim analysis, IMFINZI + chemotherapy (Arm 1) vs chemotherapy (Arm 2) met the efficacy boundary of the primary endpoint of OS and at a planned follow-up OS analysis IMFINZI + chemotherapy (Arm 1) vs chemotherapy (Arm 2) continued to demonstrate improved OS. The results are summarised below. 
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the study arms (268 patients in Arm 1 and 269 patients in Arm 2). Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (69.6%), age ò 65 years (39.6%), median age 63 years (range: 28 to 82 years), white (83.8%), Asian (14.5%), black or African American (0.9%), other (0.6 %), non-Hispanic or Latino (96.1%), current or past-smoker (93.1%), never smoker (6.9%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (35.2%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (64.8%), Stage IV 90.3%, 24.6% of the patients received cisplatin and 74.1% of the patients received carboplatin. In Arm 1, 1.1% of the patients received ò5 cycles of chemotherapy and 0.4% of the patients received ò6 cycles of chemotherapy based on etoposide exposure. In Arm 2, 62.8% of the patients received ò5 treatment cycles, 56.8% of the patients received the maximum of 6 treatment cycles based on etoposide exposure and 7.8% of the patients received PCI after chemotherapy.  
The study demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS at the planned interim analysis with IMFINZI + chemotherapy (Arm 1) vs. chemotherapy alone (Arm 2) [HR=0.73 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.909), p=0.0047]. IMFINZI + chemotherapy demonstrated an improvement in PFS vs. chemotherapy alone [HR=0.78 (95% CI: 0.645, 0.936)].  
In the planned follow-up OS analysis (median: 25.1 months), the median OS for Arm 1 and Arm 2 was consistent with the OS interim analysis. The PFS, ORR and DoR results from the planned interim analysis as well as the planned follow-up OS analysis results are summarised in Table 8. Kaplan-Meier curves for the planned follow-up OS and the interim analysis PFS are presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6. <<END_SECTION>>

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of 
IMFINZI as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 2280 patients  who were treated with IMFINZI 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 20mg/kg every 4 weeks as a single-agent and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).Sixty nine patients (3.0%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against durvalumab were detected in 0.5% (12/2280) patients. The presence of ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics or safety. 
In the CASPIAN study, of the 201 patients who were treated with IMFINZI 1500 mg every 3 weeks in combination with etoposide, and carboplatin or cisplatin and evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 0 (0%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs.   
Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications and underlying disease. 
For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to IMFINZI with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. <<END_SECTION>>
